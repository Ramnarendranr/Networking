# TCP vs UDP Comparison 

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**

    - Connection-oriented: Establishes a connection through a handshake before data transfer.
    - Reliability: Ensures data packets arrive in order and are error-checked.
    - Data retransmission: Lost packets are retransmitted.
    - Flow control: Manages data flow to prevent congestion.
    - Overhead: Higher overhead due to connection management and error-checking.
    - Speed: Slower due to the additional checks and retransmissions.
    - Use cases: Applications where data integrity and order are crucial (e.g., web browsing, email).


**UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**

    - Connectionless: No handshake; data is sent without establishing a connection.
    - Reliability: No guarantee of packet order or delivery.
    - Data retransmission: Lost packets are not retransmitted.
    - Flow control: No inherent flow control.
    - Overhead: Lower overhead due to minimal protocol mechanisms.
    - Speed: Faster because there is no connection setup or error-checking.
    - Use cases: Time-sensitive applications where speed is prioritized over reliability (e.g., video streaming, online gaming, DNS).
